<h1 style="text-align: center">Ticks</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">There are a few tick species commonly found in the Unites States. Many of them can cause skin<br /> 
irritation, but they can also cause a variety of medical problems for you, your family, and your pets,<br />
including Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Ticks are hard to control because they live in trees and bushes. Often an infestation can go<br />
unnoticed until they show up on pets or people. Outside, keeping your grass short and your trees<br />
cut back from the yard can help. We will assess, treat, and monitor your home and yard to help keep<br /> 
ticks from hanging around.</p>
